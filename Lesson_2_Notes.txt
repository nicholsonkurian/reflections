git init  --- initialize repository , also creates hidden file .git
git status   --- to get reposity status


Staged area before commit
git add filename lesson1notes
git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   Lesson1DiffNotes.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        Lesson_2_Notes.txt


git commit -m "Lesson 1 Notes Commit message"
git add lesson2notes
git commit -m "Add Lesson2 Notes as well" 


git diff   -- to find difference between working directory and staging area
git diff --staged  to find difference between staging area and most recent commit
git reset --hard  reset any changes in working directory or staging area.
git checkout master   this gets the master branch

How can you use your staging area to make sure you have one commit per locical change?
All files related to the logical change is in the staging area using git diff --staged

git branch    list out all branches in the repository
git branch branch_name
git checkout branch_name


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How wouod branches help?
It is useful when you are experimenting with a new feature in the code as you would like to try them out without effecting the master branch of the code.
This would also be helpful if the module itself is separte from other implementions and would add as a menu item to the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams give a complete picture of the code path and where it branches out or in a headless state if checkout is done at the previous commits;

git checkout -b branch_name  -- creates a new branch and checkes them out 
get on master branch
git merge master coins
git diff for comparing with parent becomes complicated as git log shows them in timestamp sequence.
So when merged the commits will be mixed with other branches.
So use the following command to get the difference in selected commit and its parent
git show commit_id

git branch -d coins

What is the result of merging two branches together?
why do we represent it in the diagram that way we do?
Codes are merged together without losing any changes to either code.
We represent them in the diagram because they follow two different path and later merge at a future point where both the master
and branch have valid changes.

while merging two brances make sure you first checkout the branch in which you want to merge the changes.
then give the merge command.

git checkout easy-mode
git merge master easy-mode
after resolving merge conflict in file
its saves the file in both  branches.
and then we have to add and to staged area and then commit to complete the merge.


What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

easy faster merges. Gives detailed conflict areas.

manual merging are tedious and time consuming.
